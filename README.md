# Consumer Price Index Prediction with Attention Encoder-Decoder Model

This repository contains the codebase for the research paper titled "An Attention Encoder-Decoder Model with Teacher Forcing Technique for Predicting Consumer Price Index." 
The paper introduces a deep learning-based approach for accurately forecasting the Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) using a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder attention model. 
The methodology incorporates the teacher-forcing technique to enhance forecasting capabilities.

## Abstract
The paper presents a novel deep learning approach for forecasting the Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI). 
The proposed model, a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder attention mechanism with teacher-forcing, demonstrates its efficacy in accurately predicting CPI by capturing long-term dependencies in inflationary factors. 
Through comprehensive experiments, the proposed method exhibits good performance, highlighting its technical soundness. 
This research investigates the effectiveness of the proposed model in enhancing prediction quality across various CPI indicators when compared to established forecasting methods. 
The study's findings illuminate promising avenues within deep learning for improving macroeconomic predictions, thereby contributing to better-informed policies to safeguard consumer interests.
